# Jump Continue

Jump Continue is a web site for allowing for the continued reuse of jumpstart theme packs, via allowing randomisation or selections of themes out of available packs.
The project is composed of:

* A set of Java processes for preparing website assets
* The site itself, as pure html5/css/javascript using jquery.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Java 11

### Installing

Build the assets with:

```gradlew.bat run```

Run the site locally with something like Web Server for Chrome, or upload in full to some location.

## Further Information

Cache folder contains the intermediate information generated by the site builder.
Site contains the website itself. Building the site creates a content.json file that contains information on all the themes available, and an atlas of card images.
